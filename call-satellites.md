# CCS2018 Call for Satellite Symposia:

Following the successful tradition of previous venues, CCS2018 will host a number of stimulating Satellite Symposia, to complement the main Conference. The satellite events are shorter (one-day or half-day) meetings with a focus on a specialized topic. All subjects that are of interest to the Complex
Systems Society are welcome.

## How to Submit Proposals:
We invite you to submit a proposal for a satellite symposium including Title, Topic (brief summary of less than 1000 words) and Format (number of speakers, invited vs. contributed, number of participants, length, preliminary program), and a preliminary list of speakers (also indicating whether they have been contacted and/or whether they have accepted).

Please make sure to mention if the proposed satellite is part of the dissemination activity of a
research project, and as such if there is some available funding to partially cover some costs.

**Submit Proposals (single PDF File) by email to**: TBA
