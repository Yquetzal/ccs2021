# Registration

The conference will be in a hybrid format, both in person in Lyon on the conference venue, and online for the participants who will not be able to travel.
The talks of the keynote speakers, invited speakers, and parallel sessions will be broadcasted to all participants through an online system.

For the Satellite workshops, there will be three types of satellites: Onsite or Hybrid formats during the conference, or Online only on Friday 22 October or during the conference. For all Satellites during the conference, all Onsite participants will be able to attend any workshop, either by connecting from where they want, or from a dedicated room (there will be one room for each Satellite on the Conference venue). For Online only Satellites, the registration fees are reduced as some of them will happen before the main Conference, hence without dedicated room on the venue. Online Registration will not allow the access to the Conference venue.

This hybrid version is intended to help people to attend the conference, whatever the current status regarding the Covid19 pandemics.
