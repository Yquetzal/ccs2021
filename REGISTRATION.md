# Registration

The conference will be in a hybrid format, both in person in Lyon on the conference venue, and online for the participants who will not be able to travel.
The talks of the keynote speakers, invited speakers, and parallel sessions will be broadcasted to all participants through an online system.
For the Satellite workshops, some will be fully on site, some online (with a dedicated room so that on site participants can attend the workshops as well) and some in hybrid formats.

This hybrid version is intended to help people to attend the conference, whatever the current status regarding the Covid19 pandemics.
