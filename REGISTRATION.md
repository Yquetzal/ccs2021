# Registration

**The conference will be in a hybrid format, both on site in Lyon on the conference venue, and online for the participants who will not be able to travel. The talks of the keynote speakers, invited speakers, and parallel sessions will be broadcasted live to all participants through an online system.**

The presenters at the conference should have a valid Registration to the conference before July 30, 2021, else the slot in the program can not be guaranteed. 

The conference hosts several Satellite workshops. Note the following conditions of organisation:
* For the Satellite workshops, there will be three types of satellites:  Onsite workshops,  Hybrid format workshops (during the conference), or Online only workshops (on Friday 22 October or during the conference). 
* For all Satellites during the conference, every Onsite participants will be able to attend any workshop, either by connecting from where they want or from the dedicated room on the conference venue (there will be one room for each Satellite on the Conference venue). 
* For participation to Online only Satellites, the registration fees are reduced as some of them will happen before the main Conference, hence without dedicated room on the venue.
* Registration for Single Day is an option only to attend Satellite workshops, and not an option for just one day of the main conference.

Final note: Online Registration (either One Day workshop or for the full conference) will not allow the access to the Conference venue; it’s an option mostly provided for people who are not able to travel.
This hybrid version is intended to help people attend the conference, especially whatever the status of the Covid19 pandemic at the time of the conference.
We are still working on the details for the poster sessions. 

## How to register to the conference ?

The procedure for Registration is in three steps:
1. The following form has to be filled to indicate important information about your registration, plus a survey about which workshop(s) you plan to attend.  https://forms.gle/yE8VRV7NQ6r3wxhQ6
2. Proper registration through the CNRS website which is asking administrative information (we are sorry that some duplicate informations are asked again, for safety reasons). https://www.azur-colloque.fr/DR07/inscription/inscription/266
3. Proper payment according to Registration fees calculated from your status and attendance. The table for Early Bird Registration fees is recalled underneath. Payment will be possible: by credit card; by bank transfer; by “bon de commande administratif” (mostly for french institutions).  Important warning for French attendants from CNRS laboratory: you cannot use a CNRS credit card to pay for the registration fees on the CNRS budget, and the use of a “bon de commande” is then mandatory.
