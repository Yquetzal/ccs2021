# In-person/online organisation
First of all, the conference is organized as a hybrid event, where onsite and online participation and presentations are possible. As for now we have ~250 onsite and ~150 online participants registered and the numbers are increasing. The event will be organized onsite, unless some national pandemic regulation forbids it. However, as the overall vaccination rate in France is high, this is an unlikely event thus we are confident that we will be able to welcome onsite participants in Lyon in person. Nevertheless, we are carefully monitoring the situation and will enforce all necessary pandemic measures (entry with green pass, masks, etc.) on site to maintain a safe event.

# Registration
Please note that all speakers (online or onsite) have to be registered to the conference. In case you have not done it yet, please register by following the instructions here: https://ccs2021.univ-lyon1.fr/#REGISTRATION. Although the early bird deadline is over, we keep the registration open for presenters with different fees for online and onsite participation. On the other hand, in case you cannot participate neither online nor onsite, please let us know so that we can remove your talk from the program. Talks without at least one registered speaker will be automatically removed from the program a week before the conference. 

# Program 
Note that most sessions will host both online and onsite talks. To organise this setting we will share zoom links and passcodes for each session, where you can follow the talks remotely and where you can present your talk. Please check your title, name and (in case of online presentations) your time zone and let us know if some adjustment would be necessary.

# Oral presentations
Contributed oral presentations (onsite or online) will have 12 minutes to talk and 3 minutes for questions. All presenters (onsite or online) need to send their slides in advance in pdf format (with size maximum 20 MB, following the mail subject field and file naming convention explained below) before the deadline October 11, 2021. In addition, online oral presenters will need to send a 12 minutes pre-recorded video about their presentation (in mp4 format, with size maximum 50 MB, following the mail subject field and file naming convention explained below*) before the same deadline, but will have the freedom to opt for a live presentation during the conference (note that delays due to technical problems during a live online presentation will not extend the assigned presentation time slot). All slides and videos will be stored on a local computer in the room, where presenters will be helped by a local organizer. Questioning sessions will take questions onsite or via zoom. All these measures are necessary to be able to organize hybrid sessions alternating between onsite and online talks, without major delays in the program.

All slides and recorded videos of oral presentations should be sent to the email address: ccs2021organizers@gmail.com not later than October 11, 2021.

# Poster presentations
There will be onsite and online poster presentations. Onsite posters should be in portrait orientation with dimensions width: 90 cm per height: 150 cm. All (onsite and online) posters should be sent in a pdf format  (with size maximum 20 MB, following the mail subject field and file naming convention explained below) before the deadline October 11, 2021. In addition, for the online presentations, we ask all poster presenters to send a 3 minutes video (in mp4 format with size maximum 20 MB, following the mail subject field and file naming convention explained below) before the above mentioned deadline.

Poster sessions will be on Monday and Tuesday during the morning coffee break (10:45-11:30) and the second half of lunch breaks (13:45-14:30). We will have enough panels to post all the onsite posters for the two days, while online-only presenters will be able to present on both days online. However, due to pandemic regulations, we need to divide onsite poster presentations into two sets, as they cannot be all present at same time alongside their posters. During the first day (Monday), we will ask half of the onsite poster speakers to present online, while the other half onsite, and on the second day the other way around (for the schedule please see the conference website). During onsite presentations speakers are expected to be close to their posters, while being in the online space during their online session. Online presentations will be carried out through the online service https://www.gather.town (credentials and details will be shared later).

All slides and recorded videos of poster presentations should be sent to the email address: ccs2021organizers@gmail.com not later than October 11, 2021.
