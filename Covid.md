# CCS2021 and COVID

The COVID-19 pandemic will probably not be fully under control at the time of the conference.

However, for now, we have good hopes to be able to host a full-scale physicial event in Lyon this October. We are all eager to meet in person again! 

We are also aware that researchers from some countries will probably be unable to attend. As a consequence, we plan to organize a mixed event, in which online attendees will be at least able to present their work and to attend streaming and/or recording of main sessions.

We are still working on the details of this organization.
