# CCS2021 and COVID

We have good hopes to be able to host a full-scale physicial event in Lyon this October. We are all eager to meet in person again! 

However, we are also aware that the COVID-19 pandemic will probably not be fully under control at the time of the conference, and thus that researchers from some countries will probably be unable to attend. As a consequence, we plan to organize a sort of mixed event, in which online attendees will be at least able to present their work and to attend streaming and/or recording of main sessions.

We are still working on the details of this organization and will keep you informed.
