# CCS2021 Call for Satellite Symposia and Online Satellite Symposia:

Following the successful tradition of previous editions, CCS2021 will host a number of stimulating Satellite Symposia, to complement the main Conference. The satellite events are shorter (one-day or half-day) meetings with a focus on a specialized topic. All subjects that are of interest to the Complex Systems Society are welcome.

**This year, we also welcome the organization of Online Satellite Symposia.**

## How to Submit Proposals:
We invite you to submit a proposal for a satellite symposium including Title, Topic (brief summary of one to two pages) and Format (number of speakers, invited vs. contributed, number of participants, length, preliminary program), and a preliminary list of speakers (also indicating whether they have been contacted and/or whether they have accepted). The proposal should also mention if the Satellite is planned as an online or on-site event.

Please make sure to mention if the proposed satellite is part of the dissemination activity of a research project, and as such if there is some available funding to partially cover some costs.



## Information Concerning the Satellite Meetings

- Location: Conference venue or Online.
- Lecture halls will be provided free of charge, and audio-visual equipment for projections will be available.
- Satellite participants will have to register following the procedure described in the conference web site. Participants who only wish to participate to the satellite and do not wish to attend the main conference will have the option to register only for a single day.
- Coffee breaks will be provided.
- All satellite symposia will be listed in the CCS2021 Booklet as well as linked and advertised on the conference Website.
- Selection of Satellite Meeting Proposals will be performed by the Scientific Committee of CCS2021. In order to optimize the offer of Satellite Symposia in terms of scientific topics, visibility and interactions, the Scientific Committee will reserve the option to propose the merging of selected proposals focusing on similar topics.
- A rule of no-repetition of the same talk across different satellites and main conference will be enforced.
- One free registration will be awarded to each satellite meeting. The satellite organizers can use it in any way they prefer (to use it for themselves, split it, or award it to an invited speaker).
