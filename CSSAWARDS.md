# Complex Systems Society Awards
The Complex Systems Society confers each year Scientific Awards that are disclosed during the annual CCS. These awards are in two categories: the senior scientific award will recognize outstanding contributions of CSS members at whatever stage of their careers, whereas the junior scientific award is aimed at recognizing excellent scientific record of CSS young researchers (within 10 years of PhD completion).

See http://cssociety.org/community/css-awards for the list of previous awardees.
