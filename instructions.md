# Oral Presentations (12'+3')

Talks for the parallel sessions will last 15 minutes total (12 min presentation+ 3 minutes for questions. There are two options for these talks:

- Live presentations
- Pre-recorded presentations (with live Q&A during the session)

All speakers have the choice between these two options.
The pre-recorded option has many advantages: it minimizes connection problems, allows you to respect the times and let you focus on the questions that attendees will ask on the chat during the talk.

If you choose the pre-recorded option, please prepare a 12 min. video with your recorded contribution. Please, do not send it to us. You will plan to show it yourself by "share screen" at the exact time of your presentation.

Lightning / Ignite Presentations (5' video)

Since your presentation is oral without any questions/answers, it is best that you pre-record your presentation in a movie (film) of duration of 5 minutes, and you send it to us by email or upload it (e.g. in Google Drive) and send us the link.

Please make sure that the total duration does not exceed the allotted period of 5 minutes. Your movie should be in Landscape mode, and not in Portrait mode. It is recommended to follow the technical instructions below for the preparation of the movie. Please check your movie carefully before you send it to us and make sure it is easily attended. We will then show your movie during the Lightning period for you, without your intervention.

Please prepare the movie and send it to us by November 25.
