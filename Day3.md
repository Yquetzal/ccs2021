# 9:00 - 13:00 Toward an interdisciplinary research agenda on digital media and human well-being
### ROOM: Rhône 4
This session will present the Digeing project and will introduce participants to the text-mining and science mapping tools used for this project (Gargantext). 

Digeing is a project funded by the European Commission that aims at synthesising the current understanding of the impact of digital media on humans' behaviour and their well-being, seed and map a new interdisciplinary research community on this topic, scope for a research agenda, and issue recommendations for policy and future digital media design.

During the project, the research community will be invited to give its input on the key challenges that should be supported by the EU in the next five years.

In late 2022 the outputs of this project will be a propective roadmap for the EU and a cartography of the main actors and research areas related to Digital Media and Human Well-Being.

For the session, participants will be granted Gargantext and a collaborative map will be generated.

The first Digeing workshop will take place in Madrid Nov. 22-24 2021.
