# CCS2021 and COVID

We have good hopes to be able to host a full-scale physicial event in Lyon this October. We are all eager to meet in person again! 

You can get information about the COVID situation in France on the french government website there:

And information provided by the conference venue: (French only for now)
https://www.ccc-lyon.com/point-dinformation-coronavirus-covid-19


However, we are also aware that the COVID-19 pandemic will probably not be fully under control at the time of the conference, and thus that researchers from some countries will probably be unable to attend. As a consequence, we organize a mixed event, in which online attendees will be at least able to present their work and to attend streaming and/or recording of main sessions.

We are still working on the details of this organization and will keep you informed.
