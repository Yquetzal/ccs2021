# CCS2021 and COVID

**Update September 1, 2021:** The event is maintained as a full-scale in person event in Lyon. We are all eager to meet in person again! (in addition to welcome online participants). 

You can get information about the COVID situation in France on [the french government website](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/coming-to-france/coronavirus-advice-for-foreign-nationals-in-france/#sommaire_1), including the list of specific rules by countries (classified in Green, Orange, Red).


You can also find on this page (https://www.gouvernement.fr/en/coronavirus-covid-19) the information about special regulations regarding COVID management while you are in France, **especially in order to enter the conference venue**:
* present a valid **HEALTH PASS** (interoperable with the EU Digital COVID Certificate) (see the definition on the linked URL above),
* wear a MASK when indoor,
* obey the various restrictions and requirements (e.g., Respect social distancing)

If you are not from a EU country, you might need to specifically ask for a health pass by applying online: see 
https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/venir-en-france/demande-de-passe-sanitaire-en-cas-de-vaccination-a-l-etranger-procedure-pour/

and

**If this case applies to you, you should request the pass as soon as possible as delays might occur.** A last minute solution would be to get tested in a pharmacy before getting to the venue.

We remind attendees that if they are not able to join us physically, it is still possible to attend the event online, as it is organized as a hybrid event.

We are still working on the details of this organization and will keep you informed.


**All regulations and restrictions might evolve, depending on the situation both in France and in other countries, so please check regularly this page and the above official government pages.**
