# Call for Abstracts

CCS2021 is the flagship conference on Complex Systems promoted by the CSS. It brings under one umbrella a wide variety of leading researchers, practitioners and stakeholders with a direct interest in Complex Systems, from Physics to Computer Science, Biology, Social Sciences, Economics, and Technological and Communication Networks, among others.

Topics covered by the Conference include, but are not limited to:

## Main Tracks

1. Foundations of Complex Systems (complex networks, self-organization, nonlinear dynamics, statistical physics, mathematical modelling and simulation, conceptual frameworks, modes of thinking, methodologies and methods, philosophy of Complexity; knowledge systems)
2. Information and Communication Technologies (Internet, WWW, search, semantic web, Blockchain, Bitcoins)
3. Psychology, Neurosciences, Linguistics (evolution of language, social consensus, artificial intelligence, cognitive processes; psychotherapeutic change; narrative complexity)
4. Economics and Finance (game theory, stock market and crises)
5. Infrastructure, Planning and Environment (critical infrastructures, urban planning, mobility, transport and energy, Smart Cities)
6. Biological and (Bio)Medical Complexity (biological networks, systems biology, evolution, natural science, medicine and physiology; biological coordination dynamics; aging)
7. Social complexity (Social networks, Social-ecological systems; Global environmental change, Green growth, Sustainability and resilience, Social groups; Change processes; Social evolution; Self-organisation and democracy)
8. Complexity in Physics and Chemistry (Quantum Computation, Quantum Synchronization, Quantum Chaos, Random Matrix Theory)
9. COVID-19 related Complex Systems
10. Methodologies (methodological challenges, methods, innovations)
11. Inter/Transdisciplinarity, applied research and calls for collaboration (‘real-world’ interventions; applied research; project proposals) 
12. Any other topic in Complex Systems

We accept contributed talks and posters. Please indicate your preference for one of the following categories to present your research:

- Regular talk
- Poster submission


### Oral Presentations
The allocated time for each oral presentations is 15  minutes, which total time for presentation +questions (12 min + 3 min). There is a tight schedule and it is important that each presenter stay within this time limit. **Presenters will have access to a laptop with LCD projector and a laser pointer**; due to the constraints of hybrid format (in the room + online), it will not be possible to connect a personal laptop. Please, prepare the presentation in a pdf format (more robust to change of computer and system) and bring your presentation to the meeting on a USB flash drive to load on the in-room laptops. You should load your presentation on one of the conference laptops before the first session, during the coffee breaks, or during lunch preceding your presentation. A support staff member will be in each room to assist with the loading.

### Poster Presentations
For each poster, display boards will be allocated. The poster area will open 30 minutes before each poster session begins each day. It is advisable to hang the posters sometime before 9:00 a.m. the day of the respective session. Posters will need to be taken down by the end of the day of each session. Presenters will be required to be next to their posters during specific time slots. Poster dimensions: **A0 size (841 x 1189 mm or 33.1 x 46.8 in) standing in portrait mode** (not as landscape -- the allocated place is 90 cm of width per 150 cm in height).
