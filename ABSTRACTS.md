# Call for Abstracts

CCS2021 is the flagship conference on Complex Systems promoted by the CSS. It brings under one umbrella a wide variety of leading researchers, practitioners and stakeholders with a direct interest in Complex Systems, from Physics to Computer Science, Biology, Social Sciences, Economics, and Technological and Communication Networks, among others.

Topics covered by the Conference include, but are not limited to:

## Main Tracks

1. Foundations of Complex Systems (complex networks, self-organization, nonlinear dynamics, statistical physics, mathematical modelling and simulation, conceptual frameworks, modes of thinking, methodologies and methods, philosophy of Complexity; knowledge systems)
2. Information and Communication Technologies (Internet, WWW, search, semantic web, Blockchain, Bitcoins)
3. Psychology, Neurosciences, Linguistics (evolution of language, social consensus, artificial intelligence, cognitive processes; psychotherapeutic change; narrative complexity)
4. Economics and Finance (game theory, stock market and crises)
5. Infrastructure, Planning and Environment (critical infrastructures, urban planning, mobility, transport and energy, Smart Cities)
6. Biological and (Bio)Medical Complexity (biological networks, systems biology, evolution, natural science, medicine and physiology; biological coordination dynamics; aging)
7. Social complexity (Social networks, Social-ecological systems; Global environmental change, Green growth, Sustainability and resilience, Social groups; Change processes; Social evolution; Self-organisation and democracy)
8. Complexity in Physics and Chemistry (Quantum Computation, Quantum Synchronization, Quantum Chaos, Random Matrix Theory)
9. COVID-19 related Complex Systems
10. Methodologies (methodological challenges, methods, innovations)
11. Inter/Transdisciplinarity, applied research and calls for collaboration (‘real-world’ interventions; applied research; project proposals) 
12. Any other topic in Complex Systems
