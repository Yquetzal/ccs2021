# Welcome to CCS 2021 
The Conference on Complex Systems, the flagship conference of the Complex System Society, is the most important annual meeting for the complex systems research community. Last year, the Conference was fully online because of the Covid-19 pandemics.

For 2021, this annual event will be held in **Lyon, France**, from **October 25 to 29, 2021**. We are confident to be able to welcome you in Lyon at this time of the year, for an in-person conference. Still, as we know that there might still be a number of travel restrictions at that time, some sessions will be organized as a hybrid conference. 

The most recent advances about the studies of Complex Systems are presented each year at the Conference on Complex Systems.
