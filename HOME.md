The Conference on Complex Systems, the flagship conference of the [Complex System Society](https://www.cssociety.org), is the most important annual meeting for the complex systems research community. Last year, the Conference was fully online because of the Covid-19 pandemics.

For 2021, this annual event will be held in **Lyon, France**, from **October 25 to 29, 2021**, at the [Centre des congr√®s de Lyon](https://ccs2021.univ-lyon1.fr/#CONVENTION-CENTER). We are confident to be able to welcome you in Lyon at this time of the year, for an in-person conference. Still, as we know that there might still be a number of travel restrictions at that time, some sessions will be organized as a hybrid conference. 

The detailed program of the conference is now visible online.
