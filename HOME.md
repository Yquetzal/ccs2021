# Welcome to CCS 2021 
The Conference on Complex Systems, the flagship conference of the Complex System Society, is the most important annual meeting for the complex systems research community. Last year, the Conference was fully online because of the Covid-19 pandemics.

For 2021, this annual event will be held in Lyon, France, from October 25 to 29, 2021. We are confident to be able to welcome you in Lyon at this time of the year, for an in-person conference. Still, as we know that there might still be a number of travel restrictions at that time, some sessions will be organized as a hybrid conference. 

## The scope of the conference
The most recent advances about the studies of Complex Systems are presented each year at the Conference on Complex Systems.

## What are complex systems ?

The most famous quote about Complex Systems comes from Aristotle who said that "The whole is more than the sum of its parts".

Complex systems are systems where the collective behavior of their parts entails emergence of properties that can hardly, if not at all, be inferred from properties of the parts. Examples of complex systems include ant-hills, ants themselves, human economies, climate, nervous systems, cells and living things, including human beings, as well as modern energy or telecommunication infrastructures.
